Given three integers a,b,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, _, ()
\_In other words, try every_ combination of a,b,c with [\_+(), and return the Maximum Obtained (Read the notes for more detail about it)
Example
With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3, here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

- 1 \_ (2 + 3) = 5
- 1 _ 2 _ 3 = 6
- 1 + 2 \_ 3 = 7
- (1 + 2) \* 3 = 9
  So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.
