# Beginner Series 4 Cockroach

The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

```
1.08 --> 30

//  1 km/hour = 1000/3600 (0.27777778) m/sec = 1000/3600*100 (27.777778) cm/sec
```

Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer
